# ML-LOAN-PREDICTION 

I HAVE ATTENDED DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP AT DEVTOWN (SEP - 2021 TO JAN - 2022)

I Have Used Libraries like 

1. NumPy => Use of NumPy Library is to Analysis the Given Data
2. Pandas => Use of Pandas Library is to generate DataFrames Through Data
3. Matplotlib => This Library will Visualize the Given Data and Shows the Result in the Graphical Representation
4. Seaborn => This is also a Data Visualization Library
5. Sklearn => This is the Machine Learning Library Where We Will Use to Selection of Model , Training and Testing The Model and Predicting The Model

I Have Dumped My Ml Model into Pickle Model Where I Can Use the Model Directly

I Have Trained The Model Using Supervised Learning Model ie; Logistic Regression 

I Have Predicted Using Logistic Regression

After Prediction My Predicted Value is 0.7886178861788617 Approximately 79 %

I Have Predicted High Accuracy ie; 79 % Accuracy Using Logistic Regression

MY SINCERE THANKS TO MY MENTOR SAHIL RAHMAN SIR WHERE I HAVE LEARNED SO MANY THINGS IN THIS INTERNSHIP
